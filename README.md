- 👋 Hi, my name is @NicolasAngioni and I’m a @Github web developper !

- 👀 I’m interested in building websites and apps from scratch to have control over everything, I believe I have a great artistic mind and always come up with new ideas of designs.
----- I also love taking my inspiration from the bests and can spend hours looking for innovative ideas of codes to learn more about my favorite subject.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Php, Javascript, the great power of MySQL, and can never learn enough of CSS.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any devs that would eventually need my help and on every projects I can enhance.
